## Individual

### Jawid

For this milestone, I learned how important it is to think more broadly about our
presentation and make it clear for every type of audience, even those without a
technical background. Working on the slides and script helped me understand how
to present ideas in a simple and engaging way, so the message can reach everyone.
As a team, we did a good job preparing the slides and script on time, and I was
able to contribute by supporting the design and practicing my part. This experience
showed me that focusing on clarity, visuals, and early preparation not only makes
the presentation stronger but also helps build confidence for the final delivery

### Omnia

For this milestone, I contributed to shaping and refining the presentation to
make sure the overall message came across clearly and effectively. I also noticed
that one area I could have worked on with the team was managing disagreements more
thoughtfully, encouraging open, respectful communication, and recognizing when
it is better to discuss and when it is more useful to debate. On the positive side,
I stayed on track with my tasks and engaged in peer feedback, which helped strengthen
the quality of our final presentation.

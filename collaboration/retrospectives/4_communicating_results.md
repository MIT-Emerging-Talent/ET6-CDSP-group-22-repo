# Milestone 4 Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Spending excessive time considering too many audience groups instead of
narrowing down quickly to the most impactful one.

## Continue Doing

- Linking the communication artifact directly to actionable insights from our results.
- Prioritizing clarity and relevance over excessive technical detail when
presenting to decision-makers, and providing a link to our work on GitHub.
- Testing communication materials internally before sending them to the audience.

## Start Doing

- Creating audience personas early to better anticipate their motivations and constraints.
- Collecting feedback from similar past communications to refine our approach.
- Integrating storytelling elements alongside data visualization to make the
results more compelling.

## Lessons Learned

- Selecting the right audience early helps focus the messaging and improves
efficiency in artifact creation.
- Matching the medium to the audience’s communication habits increases the
likelihood of engagement and action.
- A well-designed artifact not only delivers results but also demonstrates
professionalism and credibility, which can encourage the audience to act.
- Internal alignment on the “expected action” is essential before any external outreach.

## What Went as Expected

- The audience selection process successfully identified a group with the
capacity to act on our findings.
- The chosen communication medium aligned well with the audience’s preferences.

## Individual Retrospectives

### Jawid

I worked on identifying two very different audiences for our project — one from
industry and one from academia. This made me realize how important it is to
carefully choose the right, impactful person who is relevant and realistic for
the project. It also showed me the need to think more about audience selection
before starting outreach.

**Key Points:**

- **Focus:** Selected two different target audiences – a senior industry
professional and an academic researcher – for tailored outreach.
- **Lesson Learned:** Choosing the right target audience is not just about
relevance but also about their potential impact, reachability, and alignment
with project goals.
- **Challenge:** Balancing the selection of very different audiences while
considering adding more — without losing focus on those most relevant.
- **Success:** Found that LinkedIn works well for reaching both professional
and academic audiences.
- **Next Step:** Before selecting any target audience, evaluate if they are
relevant, realistic, and reachable for the project’s scope.

### Rumiya

In this milestone, our team worked on developing a communication strategy,
which included identifying and understanding our target audience. My focus was
on supporting audience identification and contributing to the refinement of our
communication approach.

- **Successes:** Although it was initially challenging to identify the target
audience, we ultimately succeeded in defining several relevant target groups
This expanded perspective strengthened the overall strategy and allowed us to
plan more effective communication methods.

- **Challenges:** The main challenge for me, as in previous milestones, was
coordination due to the team being spread across different time zones.This
sometimes made it difficult to schedule discussions and maintain smooth
workflow alignment.

- **Lessons Learned:** I learned how to better negotiate and adapt during team
discussions, ensuring that all voices were heard and that compromises could be
reached to move the work forward.

- **Next Steps & Improvement Goals:** Be more open to new perspectives and
accept changes with greater flexibility. Find ways to enhance coordination
despite time zone differences, possibly by suggesting clearer schedules or
asynchronous communication methods.

### Omnia

This milestone was challenging as it required balancing team perspectives while
maintaining realistic expectations, thinking strategically beyond our current
stage, and getting everyone aligned on achievable outcomes. I learned that
balancing ambition with realism often means starting smaller to create bigger
opportunities later. Most importantly, I learned that negative results can be valuable.

### Razan

I focused on designing and contributing to a communication strategy that
effectively connected our research outcomes to the right stakeholders. The
process required balancing clarity with impact, ensuring our message was
technically accurate while remaining accessible to the intended audience.
I learned how important it is to make our message clear and easy to understand
for the people we want to reach. I also saw that choosing the right way to
share information can make a big difference in how people respond.

# Retrospectives

This folder contains our team‚Äôs retrospectives, written at the end of each
milestone to reflect on our progress, collaboration, and learning journey.

Retrospectives are a key part of our workflow. They give us the space to step
back, assess what went well,identify areas for improvement, and draw lessons
that can guide us moving forward. Through these collective reflections,
we aim to build a stronger, more communicative, and more effective team

# ✅ Milestone 3 Retrospective  

## 🔴 Stop Doing

- Attending meetings without a clear agenda.
- Jumping into data exploration without first aligning on questions or hypotheses.
- Spending too much time fine-tuning visualizations before finalizing key findings.

## 🟢 Continue Doing

- Attending team check-ins consistently (twice a week).
- Taking and sharing meeting notes to keep everyone aligned.
- Using WhatsApp flexibly to coordinate across time zones and availability.
- Dividing responsibilities based on team members’ interests and availability.
- Using shared Google Docs for tracking progress, ideas, and research.
- Voting when disagreements arise to move forward efficiently.

## 🟡 Start Doing

- Planning and prioritizing data tasks (e.g., cleaning,
  correlation analysis, visualization) more intentionally.
- Documenting insights and decisions clearly during the data exploration phase.
- Creating shared templates for time series and correlation analysis to
  maintain consistency.

## 📘 Lessons Learned

- We practiced analyzing time series data and learned how patterns change over time.
- We explored and identified correlations between variables to uncover
  relationships within the dataset.
- We deepened our understanding of how data quality and structure affect the
  reliability of insights.
- We improved our ability to summarize and communicate data-driven findings
  clearly and concisely.

## ✅ What Went as Expected

- We completed our data analysis and submitted the milestone on time.
- Every team member contributed meaningfully by exploring parts of the dataset
   and generating insights.
- We collaborated effectively across different tools and platforms.

## ❌ What Didn’t Work

- Several variables in the dataset did not match the descriptions provided in
  the data documentation, which caused confusion during the analysis phase.
- Some variable values were inconsistent or unclear.
- Algorithms performed poorly due to weak or no correlation between features and
  target.

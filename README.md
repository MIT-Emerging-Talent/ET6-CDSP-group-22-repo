## Understanding Retail Supply Chain Delays: Collaborative Data Science Project

![Delivery meme](./4_data_analysis/images/delivery%20meme.jpg)

Welcome to **The Express**, a collaborative data science initiative developed to
investigate the persistent issue of delivery delays in the U.S. retail supply
chain. Combining real-world logistics data from Southern California and a
systems thinking approach, this project aims to uncover the complex
interdependencies among operational, environmental, and behavioral factors that
contribute to delivery disruptions. Our analysis informs strategies to mitigate
such delays and improve retail supply chain performance.

## Project Overview

Supply chain reliability has become critical for competitive success in retail,
with rising consumer expectations for fast and reliable delivery. However, U.S.
retailers continue to face delivery delays, especially during peak seasons or
in metropolitan areas. Despite technological advancements such as real-time
tracking and predictive routing, these delays persist. The Express investigates
these inefficiencies through statistical and systems-based analysis to identify
root causes and develop actionable insights.

## Problem Statement

The retail supply chain in the United States is experiencing increasingly
complex and systemic delays, causing ripple effects across customer
satisfaction, business revenue, and national logistics capacity. Our project
centers on the Southern California regionâ€”a logistics hub with high volumes of
freight movement via truck, rail, and sea. Through a data-driven approach, we
aim to answer why delivery delays continue despite modernization and how data
science can guide interventions.

## Research Questions

### Primary Research Question

What are the key operational, environmental, and behavioral factors that
contribute to delivery delays in the U.S. retail supply chain, and how can they
be mitigated using data science?

### Supporting Questions

- How do anomalies like extreme weather or pandemics affect  
  delivery reliability in urban retail supply chains?
- Which combinations of transportation, environmental, and logistics features  
  are most predictive of high-risk deliveries?
- What impact do traffic congestion, port conditions, warehouse performance,
  and environmental factors have on delivery timing?
- How do seasonal surges and disruptive events affect supply chain delivery?
- Which features have the most significant influence when considered together?

## Data Modelling and Preparation

We used a dataset titled *Southern California Supply Chain Logistics Data* from
Kaggle. It includes 32,066 records and 26 variables collected hourly between
2021 and 2024. The dataset represents operational data across multiple modes of
transport (trucks, rail, drones), enriched with GPS, sensor, and warehouse data.

### Key Preparation Steps

- Loaded and explored using pandas and Jupyter Notebooks
- Removed duplicate and irrelevant columns
- Validated column types, formats, and ranges
- Identified inconsistencies between the documented schema and actual values

### Key Feature Categories

- **Logistics**: Fuel usage, equipment availability, loading time
- **Environmental**: Weather severity, port congestion, traffic conditions
- **Operational**: Order fulfillment rate, lead time, supplier reliability

### Target Variables

- `delivery_time_deviation` (hours): Actual vs. estimated delivery time
- `delay_probability` (float): Predicted likelihood of delay
- `delay_risk_class` (categorical): Low, Moderate, High risk levels

## Data Analysis and Methodology

### Phase I: Raw Dataset

We used the dataset in its original form, applying Pearson, Spearman, and  
Kendall Tau correlation metrics to analyze relationships between 16 features  
and 3 delay indicators.

### Phase II: Corrected Dataset

After re-aligning variable definitions with documented expectations, we re-ran
the analysis. This similarly revealed weaker patterns through manual interaction
analysis.

### Summary

- Correlation matrices were mostly inconclusive
- Multivariate analysis did not show higher predictive power
- We prioritized interpretability and did not use machine learning in this
  phase, but recommend ensemble models for future work

______________________________________________________________________

## Findings

- No single variable strongly correlates with delivery delay
- Port congestion was the most consistently relevant variable
- Compound risk factors were also less impactful
- Visualizations offered clearer insights than raw correlation values
- Findings support ripple effect theories from supply chain literature

> The strongest relationship we found was only 0.0118 between port congestion
> and delivery time deviationâ€”extremely close to zero.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Known Limitations

- No temporal modelingâ€”data is cross-sectional
- Sensor data has inconsistencies (e.g., negative temps in SoCal)
- Product types (perishables vs. durables) not distinguished
- Rare disruptions (e.g., strikes, earthquakes) not captured

### Future Work

- Apply machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, SHAP)
- Use time-series and regional identifiers
- Add external data on labor, weather, and policy events
- Develop a real-time dashboard for managers

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: data cleaning, EDA, modeling
- **Tableau**: for visualization and dashboards
- **Git + GitHub**: for team collaboration and version control

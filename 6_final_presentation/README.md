**MIT Emerging Talent – Group 22**  
**Project:** Delivery Delays in Retail Supply Chains

---

## Slide 1 – Introduction

“For our group, we considered many possible topics, such as immigration or education.  
But one problem kept coming up again and again: late packages.  

We all know the frustration of waiting for something that doesn’t arrive on time.  
For customers, it breaks trust. For businesses, it creates costs.  
And delays don’t have just one cause. It could be traffic, weather, wrong routes,  
or too few drivers. Altogether, these factors make delays difficult to predict.  
That’s why we chose this problem—it’s something everyone experiences.”

## Slide 2 – Research Question

“Our main research question became: *What causes delivery delays in Southern California?*  
We wanted to see beyond anecdotes and understand the actual drivers using data.”

---

## Slide 3 – Data Challenges

“One of our first challenges was picking the dataset.  
We debated between data from the U.S., China, or three other options,  
but in the end we focused on Southern California.  
Narrowing our scope gave us a better chance to dig deeper.  

But that’s when surprises began. The variable that was supposed to be binary—  
0 for not delivered, 1 for delivered—instead contained values like 0.5 or 0.8.  
Since this dataset came from an individual rather than an official source,  
its reliability was uncertain. We had to clean and normalize the data  
before moving forward.”

## Slide 4 – Findings

“When we analyzed the data, we found that delivery delays rarely had a single cause.  
Instead, they were driven by *weak signals*—small factors that add up.  

The strongest factor was port congestion. When ports are crowded, deliveries slow down.  
Other factors included customs checks, long lead times, and risky routes.  
And when port congestion coincided with customs checks,  
the probability of delay became significantly higher.”

## Slide 5 – Insights

“Overall, our results showed that delays happen because multiple small factors interact together.  
Simple analysis doesn’t capture this full complexity.  
More advanced methods may be needed to uncover hidden drivers.”

---

## Slide 6 – Audience & Communication Plan

“The real question is: who do we share this with?  

Our primary audience is a PhD student at MIT’s Center for Transportation and Logistics.  
They face similar data challenges, are approachable, and could provide feedback.  
More importantly, they can help us connect with faculty if our work shows promise.  

Our plan is simple: reach out on LinkedIn, share our GitHub repository,  
and be transparent about our process.”

## Slide 7 – Next Steps

“First, we want to gather feedback and improve our analysis.  
If it’s valuable, we’ll connect with the broader CTL community.  

We also identified a secondary audience: retail supply chain analysts.  
They deal with delivery delays every day, so their perspective can test  
whether our findings apply to real-world operations.  

In short, our approach is: start small, learn from the right individuals,  
and then scale up to both academics and industry experts.”

## Slide 8 – Closing

“To wrap up: delivery delays are not just about traffic or weather.  
They are the product of multiple interacting factors—especially port congestion and customs.  
By analyzing these challenges, we hope to not only better understand supply chains  
in Southern California, but also to spark conversations that lead to broader improvements.”

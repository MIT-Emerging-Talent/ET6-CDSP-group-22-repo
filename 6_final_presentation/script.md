# Final Presentation Script

For our group, we talked about lots of things to work with, such as immigration or education,  
but one problem kept coming up: late packages.

We started our project by asking a simple question: *Why do packages arrive late?*  
Everyone has felt this—waiting for something that doesn’t show up on time.  
It’s frustrating for customers, and it’s costly for businesses.

There isn’t just one reason. It could be traffic, bad weather, wrong routes, or not enough drivers.  
Altogether, it makes delays hard to predict. That’s why we chose this problem—  
it’s something many people deal with.

The main research question is: *Causes of delivery delays in Southern California.*

Our first challenge was picking a dataset. We debated between the USA, China,  
or one of the three options we had. Finally, we chose the Southern California dataset.  
We thought that focusing on just one region would be the best idea so we could really concentrate  
on it and understand it well.

But once we finalized everything, the surprises began.  
The first issue was with the variable values. The number in the data is supposed to be `0` or `1`.

- `0` means the order was not delivered
- `1` means it was delivered

But instead, we saw numbers like `0.8` or `0.5`, which were confusing and didn’t make sense.  
The data came from an individual, not an official source, so we weren’t sure how reliable it was.  
We tried fixing and normalizing the data, and the results are on the next slide.

When we analyzed the data, we found that delivery delays are caused by *weak signals*—  
small factors that each add a little delay. The factor that stood out the most was the busy ports.  
A port is where ships stop to load or unload goods—when it’s crowded, deliveries slow down.

Other factors, like customs checks, long lead times, or risky routes, also add to the delays.  
When a busy port happens at the same time as customs checks, the chance of a delay is even higher.

Overall, delivery delays usually happen because multiple small factors work together,  
and a simple analysis can’t capture the full complexity.  
We may need more advanced analysis to uncover all the causes.

The real question is—who do we share this with?  
Our target audience is a PhD student at MIT’s Center for Transportation & Logistics.  
We chose them because they face similar data challenges, they’re approachable,  
and they could give us feedback. More importantly, they could help us connect with faculty  
if our work shows promise.

Our plan is simple. We will reach out on LinkedIn and share our GitHub repository.  
This way, we are being clear and transparent about our work.

First, we want to get feedback. Then, we will improve our analysis.  
Later, if it makes sense, we can connect with the broader CTL community.

We also thought about a secondary audience: retail supply chain analysts.  
They deal with delivery delays every day, and they can help us see  
if our findings apply in the real world.

So our approach is: start small with the right individual,  
learn from their feedback, and then scale up to both academics and industry experts.

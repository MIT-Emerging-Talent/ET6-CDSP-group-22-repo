# Communication Strategy

## Overview

Developed dual-target communication strategy to validate our research findings
from both academic and industry perspectives.

## Primary Target Audience: Graduate Student at MIT CTL

**Profile:** A PhD student at MIT Center for Transportation & Logistics with
strong background in analytics and data science. Specializes in supply chain
analytics, optimization, and predictive modeling. Research focuses on analytics
techniques. Active LinkedIn presence. Explicitly states their passion is sharing
knowledge.

### Capabilities & Constraints

**Capabilities:**

- Deep expertise in supply chain analytics
- Understanding of common data quality and methodology challenges
- Access to academic resources and research networks
- Ability to provide constructive feedback on analytical approaches
- Connections to faculty and broader MIT CTL research community

**Constraints:**

- Focused on own research priorities
- Limited time availability
- Limited authority to share institutional datasets

### The Strategy

**How to reach them:** LinkedIn message with link to our GitHub repository

**Strategic Approach:** We are targeting graduate students as our primary audience
for expert perspective and guidance on our findings. Based on their input, we plan
to enhance our research approach and subsequently engage with the broader MIT CTL
research community and faculty for potential collaboration and institutional-level
discussion.

**What we want them to learn:**

- Our correlation analysis found no significant predictors of delivery delay in
the current dataset
- This could indicate that traditional operational metrics have weak predictive
power for supply chain delays
- Alternatively, data quality issues may have significantly impacted our analysis
reliability
- Our methodology may have limitations that affected our ability to detect meaningful
relationships
- The challenge of distinguishing between genuine lack of correlation versus
analytical/data problems in supply chain research

**How we want them to act:**

- Evaluate our analytical approach and suggest methodological improvements
- Provide guidance on whether weak correlation results are typical in supply
chain research
- Help assess whether our findings reflect genuine lack of correlation or
analytical limitations
- Recommend relevant datasets or data resources that could advance our research
- Share general perspectives on next steps for this type of analysis
- If our improved research shows promise, potentially connect us with faculty or
researchers at MIT CTL for broader institutional engagement

## Communication Artifact - LinkedIn Message + GitHub Repository

### Justification

**Why LinkedIn Message + GitHub Repository Link:**

- LinkedIn allows us to reach our target MIT CTL graduate student who is active
on the platform, where brief professional messages are more likely to receive
responses than formal institutional emails
- GitHub repository provides immediate and full visibility into our methodology,
code, and findings
- Appropriately respectful communication style for reaching researchers with more
experience
- Allows the recipient to engage at their preferred level
- Authentic presentation of real analysis rather than simplified summaries

**Alternatives rejected:** Email (too formal, lower response rates), visual
infographic (oversimplifies technical work), presentations (too time-intensive)

### LinkedIn Message

> **Subject:** MIT Emerging Talent students seeking expert perspective on supply
chain findings
>
> Hi,
>
> We're a 5-person team in MIT's Emerging Talent Certificate Program in Computer
> and Data Science, working on a supply chain delay analysis project. We
> encountered some unexpected results and would value your expert perspective.
>
> We analyzed supply chain delay data expecting to find clear correlations
> between operational factors (port congestion, weather, customs delays, etc.)
> and delivery delays. Instead, we found essentially no significant
> relationships - all correlations came back under 0.1 across our entire
> analysis.
>
> This has us questioning whether:
>
> - Our methodology requires refinement
> - Weak correlations are typical in supply chain research
> - This might actually be a meaningful finding about supply chain complexity
>
> We've documented everything in our GitHub repository: [URL] (The README has
> a project summary for quick understanding)
>
> Given your experience at MIT CTL, we're wondering: do results like this align
> with your experience in supply chain analytics? Have you encountered similar
> weak correlations in this field?
>
> Even brief insight on whether this seems typical or unusual would help us
> determine our next steps. If our approach shows promise after your feedback,
> we'd also be interested in connecting with the broader MIT CTL research
> community.
>
> We'd greatly appreciate any perspectives you can share.
>
> Best regards,
> MIT Emerging Talent Certificate Program Team

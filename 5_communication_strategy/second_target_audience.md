> **Subject:** MIT Emerging Talent team seeking expert insight on supply chain
delay patterns
>
> Hi Shahzia,  
>
> We are **The Express**, a five-member team in the **MIT Emerging Talent
Certificate Program in Computer and Data Science**. Our current project
investigates retail delivery delays in the U.S., with a focus on Southern
California logistics.  
>
> During our analysis, we anticipated finding strong correlations between
operational factors—such as port congestion, weather, and customs delays—and
delivery performance. Instead, every correlation returned below 0.1 across the
dataset.  
>
> This unexpected outcome has left us considering three possibilities:  
>
> 1. Our methodology may require refinement.  
> 2. Weak correlations may actually be the norm in real-world supply chain analytics.
> 3. We may have stumbled upon a meaningful signal about the complexity and
unpredictability of modern supply chains.
>
> We have fully documented our work in our GitHub repository:
**[The Express Project](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-22-repo)
** *(the README includes a concise project overview)*.  
>
> Given your extensive experience in **retail supply chain data analytics** and
your reputation for open, practical knowledge-sharing, we would greatly value
your perspective:
>
> - Do these kinds of low correlations align with your experience?  
> - Have you seen similar patterns in your work?  
>
> Even brief insight on whether this is typical or unusual would help us
determine our next research steps. If our approach shows potential after your
feedback, we’d also be interested in exploring broader collaboration.  
>
> We deeply appreciate your time and expertise, and we hope our work resonates
with the challenges you’ve seen in the field.  
>
> **Warm regards,**

## Optional LinkedIn Post Content (Public Campaign)

**The Express – Investigating Retail Supply Chain Delays through Data Science**.

Our MIT Emerging Talent team analyzed real-world logistics data from Southern
 California to understand why delivery delays persist despite modern technology.

🔍 **Key findings:**

- Port congestion is a surprisingly consistent risk factor  
- Weak individual correlations highlight the need for multivariate and systemic models
- Visual storytelling helped reveal delay patterns hidden in raw data  

We’re seeking researchers in supply chain analytics, systems modeling,
or time-series forecasting to collaborate on the next phase!

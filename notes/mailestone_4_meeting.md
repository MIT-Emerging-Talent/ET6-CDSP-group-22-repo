## Meeting 2 – July 30, 2025  

**Time:** 11:20 AM EST  
**Attendees:** All team members + Instructor (Ivan)  
**Summary:**  

- Met with Evan to clarify how to choose an appropriate target audience for
   Milestone 4.  
- Shared concerns about the lack of a clear result in our project, making it
  hard to identify a concrete target audience.  
- Evan suggested a few potential target audiences such as researchers or
  consumers dealing with delivery delays.  
- After Evan left, the team discussed these ideas further and agreed to
  do individual research on target audience selection.  
- A shared Google Doc was created where each member would submit:
  - Their proposed target audience  
  - Justification for the choice  
  - A suggested communication artifact  
  - Reasoning for why this audience/artifact combination would be effective  
- Deadline for submission: 3 days from this meeting.  
- Planned to reconvene on August 5 to finalize the decision.

## Meeting 4 – August 6, 2025  

**Time:** 11:00 AM EST  
**Type:** Peer Review Meeting with Group 5  
**Attendees:** Group 22 & Group 5  
**Summary:**  

- Followed the agenda provided for peer review (see below).  
- Presented our target audience: a senior supply chain data analyst working in
  the real world.
- Explained the capabilities, constraints, and context of the audience,
  the communication artifact we chose, and our outreach strategy.  
- Received constructive feedback from Group 5 and gave our feedback in return.  
- Our feedback to Group 5 included the suggestion to consider using a
   **short video** as their communication artifact because:
  - Videos are more likely to grab attention on social media.  
  - Ministry and international organization professionals may not read long
  documents or emails, but may watch a brief, engaging video.  
  - A video could effectively communicate the message in a simple, direct way.  
- Agreed to follow up with additional **written feedback** using a
  shared Google Doc.  
- Discussed the possibility of scheduling a second peer review meeting if needed.

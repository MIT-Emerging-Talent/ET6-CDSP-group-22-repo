**Date & Time:** August 20, 2025, 12:00 PM EST  
**Attendees:** Group 22 (all members) & Group 17 (Shahzad)
**Platform:** Google Meet  
**Summary:**  

- Both groups shared slides in advance for focused review.  
- Started with introductions and exchanged how each group approached the project.
- Reviewed Group 17’s slides, gave feedback, and shared useful resources for this
milestone.
- Shahzad’s feedback on our presentation slides:  
  - Current version may be too technical and word-heavy for the final event.  
  - Suggested simplifying slides: shorter, clearer, less text-heavy, and more visuals.
  - Recommended framing with a broader audience of the final presentation event
in mind.  
- Both groups also discussed their communication artifacts and exchanged suggestions.
